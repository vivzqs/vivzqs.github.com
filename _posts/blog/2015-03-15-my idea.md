Ridge-Valley Lines on Meshes via Implicit Surface Fitting

Ridge-valley lines, curves on a surface along which the surface bends sharply, are powerful shape descriptors.

In this paper, we deal with surface creases deﬁned via extrema of the principal curvatures along their corresponding curvature lines.

In our work, we employ compactly supported radial basis functions (CS-RBFs) for global smoothing purposes. Speciﬁcally,
we use a slight modiﬁcation of the method developed in [Ohtake et al. 2003b] which is fast, not difﬁcult to implement, and can be used either for approximation or interpolation.

Given a triangle mesh, we approximate it by a CS-RBF surface and project the mesh vertices onto the surface. The curvature tensor and curvature derivatives at a mesh vertex are estimated by those at the corresponding surface point. Finally we detect curvature maxima and minima on mesh edges and trace ridges and valleys.
